# 100 Days of Code Log


**Start Date** 25 Feb 2017

**End Date** ...

**Inspiration** Many things, but basically I have a myriad of projects/ideas/things I would - and I'm currently trying - to learn and this became a nice little way to not only keep track of everything I'm doing but also to be accountable for it.

Thanks to this [post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.ykokqrmvf) for the idea, inspiration and motivation.


## Log

### Day 0: Feb 25. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time implementing styles and mockups in an Open Source Project I'm contributing on. Learn about Less, typography, mixin creation, and of course  `LESS`.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

**Link to work:** Project is on pvt on github. But I'll be adding a gist or a `less-boilerplate` repo in the near future to keep track of my learning `less`. Until now, been using `css` and `scss/sass`.

### Day 1: Feb 26. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finish the Splash Screen on the Open Source project I 'm contributing on. Reorganization of stylesheets in a component base structure. Using my [scss-boilerplate](https://github.com/dantesolis/scss-boilerplate) as starting point, but doing it in `Less`

**Thoughts:** Learning more about `flex`, `less` imports and `mixins`. Will be creating a `less-boilerplate` in the following days

### Day 2: Feb 27. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 30DaysOfJs flex panels. Setting up the project on codepen. Once it's done, I will create a simple site and make it life.
Also worked on logging my codewars kata completions. Check it at **DAILY-XTRA.md**

**Thoughts:** Learning about sass, styles, typography/fonts. Today was just the pen set up. Tomorrow begins the real work.
