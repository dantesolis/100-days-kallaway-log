# 100 Days of Code Log

**Start Date** 25 Feb 2017

**End Date** ...

**Xtra Days to add** 1

**Inspiration** Many things, but basically I have a myriad of projects/ideas/things I would - and I'm currently trying - to learn and this became a nice little way to not only keep track of everything I'm doing but also to be accountable for it.

Thanks to this [post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.ykokqrmvf) for the idea, inspiration and motivation.


## Log

### Day 0: Feb 25. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time implementing styles and mockups in an Open Source Project I'm contributing on. Learn about Less, typography, mixin creation, and of course  `LESS`.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

**Link to work:** Project is on pvt on github. But I'll be adding a gist or a `less-boilerplate` repo in the near future to keep track of my learning `less`. Until now, been using `css` and `scss/sass`.

### Day 1: Feb 26. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finish the Splash Screen on the Open Source project I 'm contributing on. Reorganization of stylesheets in a component base structure. Using my [scss-boilerplate](https://github.com/dantesolis/scss-boilerplate) as starting point, but doing it in `Less`

**Thoughts:** Learning more about `flex`, `less` imports and `mixins`. Will be creating a `less-boilerplate` in the following days

### Day 2: Feb 27. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on 30DaysOfJs flex panels. Setting up the project on codepen. Once it's done, I will create a simple site and make it life.
Also worked on logging my codewars kata completions. Check it at **DAILY-XTRA.md**

**Thoughts:** Learning about sass, styles, typography/fonts. Today was just the pen set up. Tomorrow begins the real work.

### Day 3: Feb 28. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on 30DaysOfJs flex panels. Fixing some minor bugs and getting my panels to work and my text to center. Need to still work on it.

**Thoughts:** I actually learnt that when using transitions I can not only specify each individual property I want to change, but how I want it to change it. Before I just used to do `transition: all ...`

### Day 4: March 1. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today just had time worked on the [Day 4: March 1. Wednesday](DAILY-XTRA.md) kata.

**Thoughts:** Tired today, but will be adding an extra day to my log


<hr	/>


### Day 5: March 2. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with the flex panels. Have a small little bug with toggling the `'open-active'` class and the function that calls it `toggleActive`.

**Thoughts:** Loving the `transitionend` and all other EventHandlers in Js both for messing with css and just all around. Events and it's props are becoming less frightening for me.

### Day 6: March 3. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finally fixed the bug with the transitions in the flex panels. Right now, just cleaning the codepen and the repo. But main parts finished. Just making sassy... Get it?

**Thoughts:** Need to find out more about how to add comments in `SASS`. Learnt about `evt.propertyName` to be able to see which transitions are strating/finishing when `transitionend` hits.

<hr	/>


### Day 7: March 4. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an Open "Source Project" (Stori-2). Implemented the signup page mock up in `Less`. Almost done, needs some work.

**Thoughts:** Not always easy to get styles exactly the way you want them. One thinks one knows flex well, but still have tons to learn. Although `flex` makes every thing easier.

**Link to work:** repo set to pvt

<hr	/>

### Day 7: March 5. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Working through [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview) Udemy course by Stephen Grider

**Thoughts:** Learning about the difference between a 'factory' and an 'instance' of a class. This would come accross as basic to some, but I failed an interview question because of this. A [Medium post](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-factory-functions-vs-constructor-functions-vs-classes-2f22ceddf33e#.dggo1kfq7) about it.

**Link to work:** none at the moment

<hr	/>

### Day 8: March 6. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished implementing styles for the SignUp screen on Stori-2 (Open Source project) in less. Finished Section 1 of [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview) Udemy course. Started Section 2.

**Thoughts:** Have to do a work-around on selecting the `::-webkit-input-placeholder` pseudo-class for changing the color of the text. Had created a `less` mixin but is not taking it. Need to debug it.
