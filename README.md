# 100 Days of Code Log


**Start Date** 25 Feb 2017

**End Date** ...

**Inspiration** Many things, but basically I have a myriad of projects/ideas/things I would - and I'm currently trying - to learn and this became a nice little way to not only keep track of everything I'm doing but also to be accountable for it.

Thanks to this [post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.ykokqrmvf) for the idea, inspiration and motivation.


## Log

### Day 0: Feb 25. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time implementing styles and mockups in an Open Source Project I'm contributing on. Learn about Less, typography, mixin creation, and of course  `LESS`.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

**Link to work:** Project is on pvt on github. But I'll be adding a gist or a `less-boilerplate` repo in the near future to keep track of my learning `less`. Until now, been using `css` and `scss`.
