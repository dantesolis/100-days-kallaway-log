- Updated my fork for an Open-Source project I'm contributing to. Tackling that tomorrow morning.

**Thoughts:** 

- Learnt about how to `import` and `export` components in a single line: `export * from './myComponent';` inside a common `index.js` file.

...After thinkering around:

  *webpack:*

    - learnt the difference between `path.resolve(__dirname, '/myDir')` and `path.resolve('/myDir')`. the latter creates the directory if it doesn't already exist if and it takes into account where that config file exist. Oh webpack, thanks for this small knowledge-bits 🙃.

  *console:*

    - learnt that `mkdir -p /firstDir/nestedDir/anotherNestedDir` actually creates all those directories in that order, this is vs. `mkdir /firstDir/nestedDir/anotherNestedDir` which will throw an error since those directories don't yet exist.
