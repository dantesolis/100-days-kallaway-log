# 100 Days of Code Log - Part 4 ... Another 100 Days !!! üíª üï∫ü§ñ

**This Log ended this date because I ended up being hospitalized. Beginning a new one on 01/05/2018**

*Total Days Done at the beginning of this log*: **245 Days + 30 = 275**

**NOTE:** I prefer to reset my count after 100 days to keep it more manageable.

To get the actual count just run the following snippet: 

```js
// # Note this is using flow.
/* @flow */

const addCorrectCount = (days: number= 0) :number => {
  const previousCount = 275;
  return previousCount + days;
};

console.assert(addCorrectCount(275) === 275, "Wrong"); // <= undefined :)
console.assert(addCorrectCount(275) === 0, "Wrong"); // <= Wrong
```

**Start Date** 01 May. 2018

**End Date** ...

**Total Days Done** ...

**Days Xtra to Add:**

  - ...
  ---------------------------
  Total: 0

**Inspiration:** Wanted to do continue on the path of learning and improving myself. So 100 Days is the best bet. Plus this has become a mild addiction üòÅ.
