# 100 Days of Code Log - Part 3 ... Another 100 Days !!! üíª üï∫ü§ñ

*Total Days Done at the beginning of this log*: **245 Days**

**NOTE:** I prefer to reset my count after 100 days to keep it more manageable.

To get the actual count just run the following snippet: 

```js
// # Note this is using flow.
// @flow
const addCorrectCount = (days: number): number => {
  const previousDayCount = 245; 
  return previousDayCount + days;
}
console.log(addCorrectCount(1));
```

**Start Date** 05 Dec 2017

**End Date** ...

**Total Days Done**  ...

**Days Xtra to Add:**

  - 1 day off 07 Dec. Thursday

  Total: 1

**Inspiration:** Wanted to do continue on the path of learning and improving myself. So 100 Days is the best bet. Plus this has become a mild addiction üòÅ.
