# Daily Log of katas from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com)

**Start Date** 27 Feb 2017

**End Date** ...

**Xtra Days to add** 24

**Inspiration** To be attached to my 100DaysOfCodeChallenge. Was doing it already, but stopped for some reason. Now beginning again, cause who doesn't want to solve simple algorithms? ðŸ˜€


### Day 0 & 1: Feb 27. Monday
- [to_UpperCase()](https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-friendly-uppercase-a-string/train/javascript)

- [to_LowerCase()](https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-friendly-lowercase-letters/train/javascript)

<hr/>


### Day 2 & 3 Feb 28. Tuesday
- Tried to solve converting integer into ASCII character, but couldn't solve it.


### Day 4: March 1. Wednesday

- Was totally overthinking the kata from yesterday, [Char-from-ascii](https://www.codewars.com/kata/get-character-from-ascii-value). Finally solved it. Life is good. :)
